# WhatsApp Web fullsize viewport user style
User style to make WhatsApp Web's interface occupy the full available browser viewport.

To use simply install a style manager addon (such as [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases)),
create a new rule for `web.whatsapp.com` and paste the contents of `style.css` into it.
